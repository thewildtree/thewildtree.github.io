Hello! My name's Piotrek, but you might know me better as thewildtree.

I've been thinking about creating a blog for quite some time now, but couldn't be bothered to actually do it - until now, that is.
It's not like I had to create one to apply for a GSoC internship. Not at all.

I'll try to throw something in here every once in a while, mostly documenting some programming projects that I currently am or will be working on. Also applies to GSoC-related work if I manage to get accepted.

There's also going to be something for car people in here - I've long planned to write down some of the mods done to the interior of my 2007 Citroen C4 (mostly the software-y parts), and I guess I finally have the place to do it.

Thanks for reading and I hope to put something more interesting here before the next time you pass by!
